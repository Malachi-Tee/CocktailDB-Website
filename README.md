## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  HTML and JavaScript

I created a simple HTML webpage with instructions on how to use the page. I then added Jacascript for the functionality in order to send and receive the API requests. The random button is attached to a fetch that calls a random drink and displays it on the page. The submit button takes the text the uder entered and uses it to search the Cocktail database and returns the cocktail if it is found.

## Optimizations

CSS styling
Additional information displayed. Ex. Recipes, ingredients, additional information

## Lessons Learned:

The complexity to the things you wish to do is dictated by the desired results. The Cocktail API has shown me just how powerful information can be. I could turn this simple website into something infinetly more complex to aide its usability. But it is also okay for a simple site to be simple.
